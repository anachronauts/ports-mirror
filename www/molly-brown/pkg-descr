The Unsinkable Molly Brown is a full-featured Gemini server implemented in Go.

Molly Brown is intended to be a full-featured Gemini server which is suitable
for use in pubnix or similar shared-hosting environments, where users can
upload their content but do not have access to the main configuration file (of
course, it is also perfectly suitable for single user environments, but its
multi-user supports sets it apart from many other Gemini servers).
