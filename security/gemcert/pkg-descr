A simple tool for creating self-signed certs for use in Geminispace.

Gemcert is designed to be a less overwhelming alternative to the openssl
command line tool, especially for people who don't like blindly copying and
pasting long, opaque commands without understanding them but also feel like
they shouldn't need to wade through multiple long man pages just to make a
self-signed certificate. It does just what is needed for typical Gemini server
or client certificates with sensible defaults and a handful of straightforward
options for extra control.
